# Machine Learning Modules
Created by UTSAV CHABHADIYA

This project contains 6 Modules of Machine Learning Models, such as:
1) Linear Regression
2) Polynomial Regression
3) Logistic Regression
4) K-Nearest-Neighbour
5) K-Means-Clustering
6) Neural Networks




1)Linear Regression folder contains two files in which Ml_Lib contains libraries of this algorithm and test_train file is the data trained file.

2)Polynomial Regression folder contains two files in which Ml_Lib contains libraries of this algorithm and test_train file is the data trained file.

3)Logistic Regression folder contains two files in which Ml_Lib contains libraries of this algorithm and test_train file is the data trained file.

4)K-N-N folder contains two files in which Ml_Lib contains libraries of this algorithm and test_train file is the data trained file.

5)K Means Clustering folder contains two files in which Ml_Lib contains libraries of this algorithm and test_train file is the data trained file.

6)Neural folder contains two files in which Ml_Lib contains libraries of this algorithm and test_train file is the data trained file.

Thank You
